To gather more information, we researched data from different high-street coffee shops including Starbucks, Costa, and Caffe Nero. During the investigative process, we discovered considerable differences in the amount of caffeine in drinks from different brands. This meant that we couldn't take a generic approach when coding the final calculation, and instead, we had to treat drinks from each brand separately, thus increasing some development time on the project. Additionally, we had to consider the specific requirements for different genders. For instance, a single espresso drink from Starbucks contained three times less caffeine than the same drink at Costa Coffee. Therefore, we had to research each section thoroughly to ensure that every drink and its caffeine level were accurately calculated during testing. Working in-house as the full-stack designer, illustrator and developer on the project, I determined the final user flow journeys and created illustrations for each step of the calculator by hand and then transferred them digitally to the final screens. I had to learn many different aspects of data parsing, image optimisation and time management to ensure the final calculator could be easily installed for the client within a fast timeframe. The final deliverable was created, reviewed and installed on the client's website within a month and a half alongside my colleague's consequent link-generating marketing campaign.  ",{"type":86,"name":87,"children":231,"props":233},[232],{"type":28,"text":90},{"imgSrc":234,"imgAlt":235,"imgCaption":236},"/work/Caffiene/ftd_2.png","Laptop showing the on-screen prompts","Breaking down each section into its own individual screen allowed development of the site to move smoothly, and made calculating the final result much easier.
