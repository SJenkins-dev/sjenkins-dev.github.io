### The Problem

Leinster RFC not only uses its official website for promoting their rugby matches and providing a great fan experience, but also as an extension of its work across the 12 counties of
Ireland and maintaining the love of rugby. However, its preexisting website design had since expanded beyond its current design and structure and thus required a new strategy to help it work more effectively.
There were several pain points with the pre-existing site as it currently stood:

* Fans found fixture information and ticketing information hard to access
* Leinster's domestic work was not featured on the website
* There was little fan engagement and time on the site on the whole
* Little awareness and poor site support to Leinster RFC’s womens team
* The site’s appearance needed follow Leinster RFC’s new branding approach
* Increase ticket and merchandise sales

### The Strategy

Working as lead designer at Sotic Ltd, I provided a complete site redesign, design system and content strategy rework for Leinster RFC, including an updated design system based on their new brand identity, a upgraded fan experience for booking ticket/matches as well as designing a new approach for match statistics and data visualisation displays alongside Sotic’s development team.

A 'next fixture' card was also added to the hero section that included mens and womens fixtures, allowing the hero area some needed dynamism as well as allowing fans to book tickets directly. A streamlined mobile experience was also provided, allowing fans a much easier throughline to book tickets. " />
