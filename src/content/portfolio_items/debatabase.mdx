### The Brief

[Morph Suits](http://www.morphsuits.co.uk/) is a fancy dress retailer based in the heart of Edinburgh, specialising in the production of full body fancy dress costumes for a wide range of characters and themes from movies and pop culture. As part of a promotional marketing campaign based around the Baftas and Oscars ceremonies for 2016, a encyclopedic-style mini site was proposed, showing the company's true love of film. The site aimed to show the best actors and actresses over the 50 years based on the amount of Oscar and/or Bafta awards they had won throughout their career.

### The Strategy

<caseStudyImage imgSrc="/work/Debatabase/debatabase_2.jpeg" imgAlt="Notebook showing the process in organising the information" imgCaption="The site was designed with two specfic sections in mind - the full list of actors, an individual actor page with a third section designed to be a pop-up window that activated on each entry in the graph." />

<caseStudyImage imgSrc="/work/Debatabase/debatabase_3.jpeg" imgAlt="Notebook showing the process in organising the information" imgCaption="Each list page went on to display each individual actors accolades in a full list, allowing users to directly compare each actor against each other." />

Clicking on the individual actor then displayed a graph, which showed the filmography of the actor based on that film's Rotten Tomatoes rating and which films earned the actor a Bafta and/or Oscar respectively. The graph itself was one of the trickiest aspects of the site to implement, but was an essential part of giving the entire site its effectiveness.

<caseStudyImage imgSrc="/work/Debatabase/debatabase_4.jpeg" imgAlt="Notebook showing the process in organising the information" imgCaption="The graph overview allows users to see the breadth of the quality of an actors full filmography and exactly when and where they earned an award for their work." />

The site was built with a Bourbon Neat framework.
