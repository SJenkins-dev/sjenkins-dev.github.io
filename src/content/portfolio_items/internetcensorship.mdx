### The Brief

In a dangerous world where internet censorship is becoming more and more commonplace, [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/) offers greater
internet freedom and accessibility on almost any consumer available device. However, not everywhere has that accessibility. As a way of promotiong
their services, IVPN requested an online, interactive data visualisation displaying all internet accessibility across the world in a simple to understand format.

### The Strategy

Working alongside an SEO consultant, we decided to take a conservative approach and display the data in as clear and straightforward a way as possible. We also decided that implementing a map showed correlations in internet security policies, and gave a fantastic communication method to show the results of our data research. We split the minisite into three specific sections:

1. a homepage giving a summary of the minisiteâ€™s goals
2. an individual country breakdown, displaying the specific security criteria for that country
3. 3 x top ten lists showing each the countries with greatest restrictions on content, the countries with the highest amount of user rights restrictions and the countries with the top level of obstacles for access.

### The Outcome

The final site is expansive and information packed, with each country being clickable to show more information.
Alongside an interactive map, expansive lists were also provided, revealing the top countries with the most restrictions.
