### The Problem

Aberdeen FC Community Trust was first established in March 2014 to help support the local communities and people of Aberdeen with the vision 'to provide support and opportunity to change lives for the better' through the medium of football and healthy living. Their website provided information on the extent of their charitable work across the city while also providing an area for people within the area to discover and/or book their services directly. However, the current iteration of the website failed to describe the extend of their work. The new website had to accomplish the following:

* Spread awareness of Aberdeen FC Community Trust's extensive programmes in both their 'Education and Postive Destinations' and 'Football, Health and Wellbeing' sections
* Help make discovering and booking sessions in those areas considerably easier
* Allow users to make donations directly through the website.

### The Solution

While working as lead designer at Sotic Ltd , I helped develop a new customer facing approach to promote Aberdeen FC Community Trustâ€™s community programmes, donation opportunities and charity work as well as providing a full visual refresh for their site based on their pre-existing print visual guidelines.
