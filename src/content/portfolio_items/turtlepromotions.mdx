### The Problem

Lucy Turtle is a music promoter based in the Swansea and South West Wales area. However, her pre-existing logo no longer reflected the style of music she promoted nor the style of the bands she managed. Working as a freelancer for the client, I was originally hired to create regular music posters for various unsigned indie and alternative bands across the area. Later, I was asked to modernise and update the brand to attract a new audience to band performances.

The new logo and subsequent rebrand needed to accomplish the following:

* Attract a new audience and maintain the preexisting audience of Turtle Promotions within music venues around the Llanelli, Swansea and Port Talbot areas.
* Modernise the organisation and expand the versatility of the logo for other aspects of the business

> The new mark had to be used as an entry stamp to prove gig attendees had purchased tickets.

### The Strategy

The new logomark needed to reflect both a quirky, fun attitude but also the music loving nature of the business. As well as this, the new mark had to be used as an entry stamp to prove gig attendees had purchased tickets. Playing specifically on this requirement, the logo concept was developed on a play on the name of the client and a guitar fret, created in a 'tattoo-esque' style. This worked fantastically well when simplified into a simple ink stamp for gigs, and became a point of discussion for many music fans at the gigs.

Later expansions were added onto the brand identity, including promotional t-shirts and shareable digital assets for other graphic designers commissioned to work on promotional gig posters.

### The Result

Custom poster designs were commissioned for each gig that the client was promoting, all performed by artists in venues in Llanelli, 
Swansea and Port Talbot. In a very competitive market, these posters needed to be highly visual and eye-catching, cheap and easy 
for the client to print while also expressing the indie feel of the artists that Turtle Promotions supported.
