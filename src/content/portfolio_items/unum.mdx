### The Problem

[Unum](https://www.unum.co.uk/) is a company with the employee in mind. They vouch for protecting the employee and help businesses to introduce better benefits for their staff. However, they believed that awareness of their services was not known by their target market and they required an SEO campaign to help businesses and employees and spread more knowledge of their products. 

> A detailed densely-packed flowchart would be less engaging for a busy manager to sit down and process on social media.  Therefore, if the content required active participation, a manager would be more likely to interact with the content.

### The Strategy

The SEO consultant working on the campaign initially researched and pitched a static flowchart infographic targeted towards business managers and startup managers on choosing an engaging workaway day for their employees that would be shareable via social media platforms. They had initially briefed me to create this infographic with 24 potential solutions and an additional resource link for each. However, working as the in-house designer on the project, I recommended expanding the project into an evergreen online app hosted on Unum’s website. Thus, I proposed that this would achieve several things that a single static graphic would not necessarily accomplish:

* A detailed densely-packed flowchart would be less engaging for a busy manager to sit down and process on social media.  Therefore, if the content required active participation, a manager would be more likely to interact with the content.
* Make booking away days easier for managers, achieve their tasks faster and reduce their cognitive load: resources and links to businesses providing the away days could be included within the web app 
* Having a hosted tool on Unum's domain would increase and maintain traffic on the tool, encouraging managers to engage with Unum’s resources and services more as a secondary goal.
* Create more of a social discussion/ marketing point on the website - the evergreen piece of content could be regularly expanded with newer away day options and strategies e.g. what makes a good away day? What benefits could away days give employees?
* Provide an additional market for the tool, inspiring employees and team leaders to suggest an away day as a way of unifying their prospective teams.

Despite this alternative idea increasing the workload for the project, the SEO consultant pitched this new idea to Unum to a positive response.

### The Process

I worked alongside the SEO consultant in a full-stack capacity, expanding their initial research and copywriting into the complete web application: producing initial wireframes for the tool, creating visuals and illustrations while maintaining Unum’s visual guidelines and then finally planning, developing the final solution within the timeframe of a month.
