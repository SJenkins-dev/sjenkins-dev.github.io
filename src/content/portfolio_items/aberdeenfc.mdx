### The Problem

Aberdeen FC had requested a new brand refresh of their pre-existing fan website to effectively use it more
efficiently for marketing as well as communicate football events, fixtures and player stats.
There were several pain points with the pre-existing site as it currently stood:

* Fans found fixture information and ticketing information hard to access
* There was little fan engagement and time on the site on the whole
* Little awareness and poor site support to Aberdeen FC’s womens team
* The site’s appearance needed follow Aberdeen FC’s new branding approach
* Increase ticket and merchandise sales
* Little awareness of the RedTV video platform

> The real challenge that the final design had to be flexible...

### The Strategy

<caseStudyImage imgSrc="/work/Aberdeen/aberdeen_2.png" imgAlt="Screenshot of the Aberdeen FC website shown on various devices, including an iPad, a laptop and mobile" imgCaption="A 'train departure' board was included on the main homepage, allowing fans to see team updates at a glance. This included the next match with direct links to book tickets, a fixtures area which included links to match reports, and a league table, allowing fans to track their favourite team's performance." />

Working as the in-house designer on the project while at Sotic Ltd,
I first started with a content audit of the entire site and its subpages.
In doing so, a new direction was discovered for the design and why certain pages were not performing as expected. Following on from my site audit, I then began creating a new design system and content approach following Aberdeen FC’s updated
brand guidelines. A few issues had appeared here, such as accessibility concerns given Aberdeen FC’s new shade of red. The real challenge that the final design had to be flexible - the design system was created with an ‘atomic’ methodology in mind, allowing various different forms of content to be used on the website smoothly.

* Where possible infographics were used instead of textual data - this made the fan experience considerably more approachable and encouraged more fan discussion
* A ‘train departure’ board was included on the home page - this gave fans a readily-accessible area to discover the latest news about their favourite team at a glance including the latest match and being able to purchase tickets quickly.
* Both the mens and womens teams were now treated with the same priority in the site navigation, allowing them to both share fan awareness.
