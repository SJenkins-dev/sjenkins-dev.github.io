      ## **Hello!** My name is Stacey!


      I have been a multidisciplinary designer and illustrator, specialising in
      digital product design, front-end development and digital illustration for
      11+ years, giving me a unique understanding of design from both designer
      and front-end developer perspectives.

      ### How can I help?


      I have extensive experience working in multiple sectors in both agency and
      in-house roles, and pride myself on my passion for my craft, my genuine
      curiosity and my love of creating the best design solution for every
      client.


      I have worked with many brands in digital marketing and SEO, sports,
      public service, internal employee communications and financial marketing.
      Within these roles, I have often gone beyond the line of duty, including
      pitching and negotiating with clients directly on many conceptual projects
      as well as copywriting, proofreading and even coding prototypes where
      required. I am also a passionate accessibility advocate and use a holistic
      design process with the user in mind at every stage, ensuring that both
      the user goals are achieved with the client goals in an effective and
      beautifully integrated solution.


      For more information on how I can help, please feel free to [get in
      touch](#contact) with me below. I can also be contacted via my [LinkedIn
      profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sj-design).
